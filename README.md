# self-exec-last-will
A self executable last will in the format of a Solidity smart contract, compatible with the public Ethereum blockchain and relevant EVM-powered protocols and layers.

I had this idea for years, and now with modern AI tools, and minimal tech knowledge, I believe it is feasible, and if adjusted and correctly implemented would provide a glimpse into true DLT-powered intel exchange and authentication, put the monetary aspect aside.

The idea is proposing a smart contract that either stores digital assets like ethereum, erc20 tokens, and ownership contracts in the NFT spectrum and/or accesses wallets containing insured assets (if possible). The contract monitors signals from a health technology company to confirm the status of a person's health. If the person passes away, the smart contract automatically distributes the assets to the pre-specified beneficiaries, such as family members, without involving lawyers or insurance companies. This demonstrates the benefits of distributed ledger technology for secure data exchange and authentication, beyond just financial transactions.

I am pasting the results of my convo with chatGPT-4, obviously it's far from ideal, but I will try to rework it over time. Please feel free to suggest ideas or contribute. Besides the .sol  contract,  it is important to think and define how could a HIT company create an authonomous framework, I presume by leveraging low-hanging I.4.0 fruits such as AI, IoT, and Blockchain, to be in position to update the chain every x blocks or every block even with live data in regards to the health status of individuals using the self-exe-last-will protocol/tool.

It might seem like an ambitious plan at first glimpse, yet I am confident it's feasible and it will benefit everyone involved, except leeches.
